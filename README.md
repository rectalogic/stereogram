Process an uploaded image using [Depth Anything v2](https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/depth-anything-v2-base)
via [Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/main/en/index).
Then display an interactive stereogram of the image using a [three.js](https://threejs.org/) fragment shader.
